README: Chatroom Project - Aidan & AndrewFor our server, we used Node.js. So, to compile our server, you will need node installed:https://nodejs.org/en/Direct terminal to the project directory and run the following commands to install dependencies.npm installnpm install --save express@4.15.2npm install --save socket.ioCompile the server and run it by using: “node index.js”, it will be listening on port 1134.For our client, we used web browsers. Visit localhost:1134 if you’re hosting the server on the same computer, or visit [IP Address]:1134 if you’re trying to connect from a different machine.Once the webpage loads, enter a username in the textbox specified, and then it will attempt to connect! If you try to enter a username that’s already in use, a number will be appended to your username and you’ll connect with that new username. Once you connect, the textbox to enter a username will be removed.Enter messages in the specified box. Use “@[username]” to send private messages.Recipients of the DM message will have their text boldedWhen you disconnect the chat will be notified you have left.
